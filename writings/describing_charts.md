### Tips

1. If you are doing an exam task, read the instructions and make sure you write according to the word and time limits.
1. Start by saying what the charts show. In an exam, change the words in the question to write the first sentence of your answer, e.g. *These charts show = These charts illustrate.*
1. The second paragraph should provide an overview of the key features of the information.
1. The other paragraphs should describe the patterns or trends in more detail. However, only select the most important ones to write about, and don't write about your own ideas.
1. Use linking words and a range of vocabulary to describe what you see in the charts. (You can write % or per cent, but be consistent.) 
1. Be careful to use the correct tenses to describe the time periods shown.
