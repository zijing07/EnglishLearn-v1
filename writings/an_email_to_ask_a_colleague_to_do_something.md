## An email to ask a colleague to do something

### Topic
You would like to ask help from Yuki to do some work for the next meeting with clients.

### Tips
1. Some people prefer you to use their first names, and others prefer you to use their title (e.g. *Ms/Mr*) + their surnames. Find out what is normal in your company when writing emails.
1. Explain the reason for the request.
1. Give a deadline when possible.
1. Give dates clearly.
1. Make your request polite by starting it with *Do you think you could … ? or I would be grateful if you/we/I could … .*
1. If you don't know the person you are writing to well, you can finish by writing *Best regards* just before you sign your name.
